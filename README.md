A high-performance Python library for generating analytic B-spline expressions 
using NumPy instead of symbolic computation. FAST-B provides mathematically 
equivalent results to symbolic approaches but with significantly improved 
performance through intelligent caching and efficient numerical computation.

## Key Features

- **âš¡ High Performance**: 10-1000Ã— faster than symbolic computation through memoization
- **ðŸŽ¯ Mathematical Precision**: Faithful implementation of Cox-de Boor algorithm
- **ðŸ”§ Flexible Boundaries**: Support for mixed open/closed boundary conditions
- **ðŸ“ˆ IGA Ready**: Direct application to Isogeometric Analysis
- **ðŸŽ¨ LaTeX Output**: Beautiful mathematical representation of functions
- **ðŸ’¾ Efficient Caching**: Automatic memoization of computed expressions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tctheodsiou/fast-b.git
cd fast-b
pip install -e .
```

## Quick start
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
from src.nurbs.bsplines import CardinalBSpline

# Create a quadratic B-spline
B = CardinalBSpline(m=2)

# Evaluate at multiple points
x = np.linspace(0, 3, 1000)
y = B(x)

# Compute derivatives
B_prime = B.diff(1)  # First derivative

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, B(x), label="B(x)")
plt.plot(x, B_prime(x), label="dB/dx")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```

## Architecture
FAST-B is built on a hierarchical architecture:
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ bsplines/         # B-spline implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ containers/       # Knot vectors and data structures
â”œâ”€â”€ nurbs/            # NURBS support
â”œâ”€â”€ piecewise/        # Piecewise function framework
â”œâ”€â”€ spaces/           # Function spaces
â””â”€â”€ system/           # Caching and core utilities
```

## Core components
- **Polynomial Foundation:** Enhanced numpy.poly1d with algebraic operations
- **Rational Functions:** Support for NURBS and rational B-splines 
- **Piecewise Framework:** Domain-aware function management
- **Caching System:** Intelligent memoization for performance
- **B-spline Engine:** Cox-de Boor algorithm implementation

## Research Applications
FAST-B has been successfully used in:
- Isogeometric Analysis: Efficient basis function generation for IGA
- Wavelet Development: Creation of derivative-orthogonal non-uniform B-spline 
  wavelets
- Computational Mathematics: Research in numerical methods and approximation 
  theory
- Engineering Applications: finite element analysis, and geometric modeling
